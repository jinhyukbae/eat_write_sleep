### This Project was made by Flask API

##### 2023-04-14 Added a Flask file that includes features like diary writing, notices, public diary, and login/sign-up (Chaewon)
##### 2023-04-17 (Shared with all) Added grammar correction to diary writing, incomplete tag creation (sentence summarizing) for diary content, modified the form of public diary.
##### 2023-04-19 (for Sangjun, Jinhyuk) Uploaded 'myproject' on GitHub for sharing. Cleaned up the folder. (Chaewon)
##### 2023-04-24 (for all to share)
- (Resolved) "Truncation was not explicitly activated but max_length is provided a specific value, please use truncation=True to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to truncation." <br>
Issue related to grammar.py: When 'Review+Save' is clicked, the sentences do not all come out in grammar-checked state, and about 50% are omitted. <br>
Assuming it's a problem with max_length, truncation. <br>
Sharing as the error hasn't been resolved yet. (Chaewon)

##### 2023-04-26 (for all to share) Code worked on until 04-25 has been deleted due to an overwrite. Recovering member information modification feature and diary grammar check feature.
##### 2023-04-26 + Added public diary sorting feature
##### 2023-04-27 (for all to share) Member information modification feature completed
##### 2023-04-28 Paraphrases feature error fixed (+ close button)
##### 2023-05-04 Experiment

### "killed"

- The Gunicorn process that is currently running continues to display a message that the Worker process has been terminated along with the "CRITICAL WORKER TIMEOUT" message. These messages can occur when the Worker process does not respond or cannot complete the task within a certain time.

- Typically, this problem can occur when the processing time of the web application is too long. In this case, the problem can be solved by optimizing the code, separating tasks that take a long time to process into background tasks, or adjusting the Gunicorn settings to increase the number of Worker processes or adjust the request wait time (timeout).

- Therefore, in this case, you need to adjust the Gunicorn settings or analyze the application code to identify the cause and solve it.


#### Modifications on 2023-05-09
- Changed the order of the titles in the navbar and sidebar: Notice, User Manual, Public Diary, Diary Writing

### Move to Docker
